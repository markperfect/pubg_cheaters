# Analyzing Cheating in PUBG

This project analyzes the instances of cheating in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ("PUBG") a online multiplayer battle royale game. As detailed in 'PUBG Project Overview.ipynb', the project investigates whether those who observe cheating are more likely to start cheating themselves.

First, players are identified if they observe cheating taking place. They are considered 'new cheaters' if they begin cheating themselves. Then, the matches are randomized in order to better identify causality. Finally, the number of new cheaters is counted and plotted.

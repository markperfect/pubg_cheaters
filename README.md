# Analyzing Cheating in PUBG

This project uses data from PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ("PUBG"), an online multiplayer battle royale game, to determine whether observing instances of cheating makes a player more likely to cheat.

First, players are identified if they observe cheating taking place. They are considered 'new cheaters' if they begin cheating themselves. Then, the matches are randomized in order to better identify causality. Finally, the number of new cheaters is counted and plotted.
